Suppose you wake in a bleak room decorated with nothing but a sign that reads: “This experiment is for you alone. Remain still for one minute and, in addition to yourself, a single life shall die; move and half of all life shall die, rounding down.” This simple situation, through bypassing the traditional shirking of bad vs. worse dilemmas by non-consequentialist theorists, who  is able to get at the root of the problem plaguing both Immanuel Kant’s theory of deontological ethics and Peter Singer’s interpretation of consequentialist ethics.

Immanuel Kant’s deontological theory of normative ethics asserts that the moral value of an action should and can only be determined by the metaphysically intrinsic properties of that action itself, regardless of how instinctually abhorrent the consequences may seem to us. This can lead Kantian ethicists to recommend some dangerous, although seemingly logically consistent, extremes. As Gordon Marino writes in Ethics: The Essential Writings, “if, for instance you could save the lives of thousands . . . by torturing one innocent, most followers of Kant would insist that the millions must be prepared to die” (Marino, 2010). For Kant, the sole determining factor of the morality of an action is its adherence to a categorical, rather than hypothetical, imperative. The most important for him is his first formulation, which reads, “act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a Universal Law of Nature” (Kant, 1785). For example, if one proposed the maxim, “if I am lacking food, I must steal it,” its moral worth must be determined by generalizing the claim into a “Universal Law of Nature” and analyzing whether the maxim could be truly be one. Ignoring the questionable assumptions that there exists an absolute standard of reason, that everyone’s capacity for reason is identical, and that moral worth even exists and can be drawn from the universalization of a maxim, a maxim fails Kant’s first formulation if it can not be universalized, either through logical contradiction or an inability to “will” it to become a law of nature. When universalized, the proposed maxim of stealing food when hungry fails the first formulation, as stealing is supposedly something we could not entertain if it was made into a law that was adhered to by everyone. While this theory of ethics may on the surface appear at least rational and logically consistent, it completely turns a blind eye to the number of instances in which the supposed situation will occur. A situation must be assessed in the same exact manner, regardless of if the situation will occur once throughout all time, or is a daily occurrence for every moral agent. This is precisely what the thought experiment I have presented is designed to test: a situation in which, if forced to decide between bad and worse, Kantian deontological ethics would require one to choose the worse option solely because the bad—but better—option could not be willed into a universal law.

Suppose a stout believer in Kantian ethics was placed in the hypothetical room. After considering their options, they attempt to apply the categorical imperative to this maxim they created: “If I wish to preserve the most life in a situation wherein I am forced to decide between remaining still and killing myself in addition to another life or moving and killing half of all life, I must remain still.” Because the agent is placing value in humanity (treating it as an end in itself) and acting to fulfill a duty to humanity, their maxim is compatible with Kant’s conception of duty and value, as, according to Kant, “man and generally any rational being exists as an end in himself, not merely as a means to be arbitrarily used by this or that will . . .” (Kant, 1785). Given that the maxim is compatible with Kant’s second formulation, or, “[acting] in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end,” the Kantian must now assess the maxim through consideration of if they could will it to become a universal law at the same time, even if they know that the situation they are in will only occur once throughout all time (Kant, 1785). This means that although standing still and letting two lives die would be the best outcome up to a certain amount of occurences, it ceases to be the best option when universalized. as it would result in the existence of no life, while if everyone moved and killed half of all remaining life (rounding down), one life would remain. Therefore, according to Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative, even if the situation would never occur again, and moving would without question produce more death than standing still, you should still choose to move and kill half of all life, as this becomes the maxim that holds up when universalized: “If I wish to preserve the most life in a situation wherein I am forced to decide between remaining still and killing myself in addition to another life or moving and killing half of all life, I must move.”

This is one of the most glaring flaws with deontological ethics: in judging moral value it fails to acknowledge the frequency of the event, and simply assumes universal participation for the calculation. Immanuel Kant may claim that “the moral worth of an action does not lie in the effect expected from it,” but the categorical imperative’s process of universalization simply shirks the inherently necessary consequentialist analysis to a hypothetical situation in which the maxim in question was universally applied by everyone, regardless of the situation’s realistic frequency (Kant, 1785). Deontological theories of ethics are simply consequentialist theories that assess a hypothetical situation, rather than the expected. Kant attempts to disguise this through grounding morals in some form of metaphysics, but the underlying folly remains. Thus, rather than incorporating the actual context of a situation into the assessment, Kantian deontological ethics needlessly removes the distinction between reality and fantasy. It requires moral agents to act in a manner that, in a situation of Kant’s creation, would be best, but, in practice, causes significantly more harm than need be. As seen in the preceding thought experiment, if everyone (in a fantastical situation of Kant’s design) chose to kill half the population, one person would remain alive, while if everyone chose to kill themselves and a single other, zero people would remain alive. Thus, Immanuel Kant would assuredly implore you to kill 3.7 billion people (half of the current population) instead of two (another and yourself), and label you immoral if you failed to do so. This is so because, according to Kant, there is no way to morally act in opposition to the categorical imperative, as all such instances of immorality are supposedly done in our own self-interest, even if the action explicitly hurts ourselves and helps our collective humanity: “if now we attend to ourselves on the occasion of any transgression of duty, we shall find that we in fact do not will that our maxim should be a universal law, for . . . we assume the liberty of making an exception in our own favor or . . . in favor of our inclination” (Kant, 1785).

Consequentialism, another prominent theory of normative ethics, and one espoused by moral philosopher Peter Singer, determines the ethical value of an action solely through examination of the actual consequences, rather than the hypothetical consequences of a universalized situation. It thus recommends an agent a course of action much more in line with our natural instincts (as actual consequences are all that observably occur, and our neurophysiology has evolved to weigh dilemmas in favor of such outcomes), rather than the completely divorced-from-reality, metaphysical considerations of Immanuel Kant’s deontological ethics. One of Peter Singer’s primary aims in “Rich and Poor” is to build an argument that asserts that letting a person die is morally equivalent to killing them: “there is no intrinsic difference between killing and allowing to die. [There] are extrinsic differences, that is, differences normally but not necessarily associated with the distinction between killing and allowing to die” (Singer, 1993).
